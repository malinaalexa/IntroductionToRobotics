## Homework 1
In this homework, I installed the Arduino IDE, created a private GitHub repository named "IntroductionToRobotics", granted access to specified users, and provided an informative repository description.

## Homework 2
For this assignment, I tried controlling an RGB LED using three potentiometers with Arduino, in order to use each potentiometer to independently control the intensity of the Red, Green, and Blue channels of the RGB LED.

I used the following components: 
- one RGB LED
- three potentiometers
- three resistors 
- wires to set up the connections. Note that dark colors - blue and black - were used for minus and bright colors - red and yellow mostly - for plus.

I read the analog values from each potentiometer using Arduino and then mapped those values to control the respective LED channels.

I included the code used for the project in the homework2_RGB folder, and a picture of the setup below:

i have additionally added a link to a video showing that the setup is indeed working, which can be viewed at https://youtu.be/PtYLPSejM6A?si=s0xpZvtWt_mFTpGi.
